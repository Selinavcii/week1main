      Forrest Gump is a 1994 American epic romantic comedy-drama film directed
      by Robert Zemeckis and written by Eric Roth. It is based on the 1986 novel
      of the same name by Winston Groom and stars Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary
      Sinise, Mykelti Williamson and Sally Field. The film follows several
      decades in the life of a slow-witted and kindhearted Alabama man named
      Forrest Gump (Hanks) and his experiences in the 20th-century United
      States. The film differs substantially from the novel. Principal
      photography took place between August and December 1993, mainly in
      Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Extensive visual effects were
      used to incorporate Hanks into archived footage and to develop other
      scenes. The soundtrack features songs reflecting the different periods
      seen in the film.
